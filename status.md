I'll analyze the current state of gotorch by examining several key aspects:

1. Core Infrastructure
- ✅ Basic tensor operations and management
- ✅ CPU/GPU device support
- ✅ Memory management and GC integration
- ✅ Error handling system for C++/Go interop
- ✅ Basic type system aligned with libtorch

2. Tensor Operations
Current coverage:
- ✅ Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, etc.)
- ✅ Matrix operations (mm, matmul)
- ✅ Shape manipulation (reshape, view)
- ✅ Basic indexing and slicing
- ❓ Advanced indexing capabilities (need verification)
- ❓ Complex number support (need verification)
- ❌ Sparse tensor operations (appears missing)

3. Neural Network Components
Modules implemented:
- ✅ Linear layers
- ✅ Convolution layers
- ✅ BatchNorm
- ✅ Basic containers (Sequential)
- ❌ RNN/LSTM/GRU layers (appears missing)
- ❌ Transformer layers (being added in recent PR)
- ❌ Embedding layers (appears missing)


4. Optimizers
- ✅ Basic optimizers (SGD)
- ❓ Advanced optimizers status unclear (Adam, RMSprop, etc.)
- ❌ Learning rate schedulers (appears missing)

5. Loss Functions
- ❓ Status of common loss functions unclear
- ❓ Custom loss function support unclear

6. Data Loading & Processing
- ✅ Basic image loading
- ✅ Common transforms
- ❌ Dataset abstractions (appears limited)
- ❌ DataLoader parallelization (appears missing)

7. Serialization & Model Management
- ✅ Basic model saving/loading
- ❓ Checkpoint management (need verification)
- ❓ State dict handling (need verification)
